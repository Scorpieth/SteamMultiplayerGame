Basic Template for Steam Multiplayer.

This setup currently has a demo scene for third person (top-view) 3d. You can switch out all the World implementations to your own, this is primarily meant for 3D and has not been tested for 2D.

This comes packed with a very basic lobby implementation.

## OBS
Currently the leave butt on is not implemented, I should probably get to that at some point.. Soonâ„¢
